Mod for CDDA-BN that adds 3 grid machines to help speed up the process of making biodiesel through farming produce.

Seed extraction machine:
A grid machine that crafts seeds from plants and fruits 2x faster than by hand. Uses a decent amount of power to run but not too crazy.

Cold oil press:
A machine that crafts both vegetable cooking oil 80% faster and vegetable oil blend at the same speed and 20% more efficient. Uses a bit more energy than the seed extraction machine.

Pyrolysis reactor:
Speeds up the crafting of biodiesel by 2x the normal speed. Uses a LOT of power.

Vegetable oil blend:
It's a more crude type of vegetable oil, very unhealthy to drink. Can be refined further into vegetable cooking oil or used as it is to craft biodiesel.

ps: all seed crafting recipes had their results and times multiplied by 4 while the vegetable cooking oil had theirs multiplied by 20 when using the cold oil press. This way you can trully craft 100s of units per craft instead of a measily 50 vegetable cooking oil when crafting 50 batches. :D
